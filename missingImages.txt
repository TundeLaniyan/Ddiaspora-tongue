I am certain
I am not ready yet
I am not sure
I am thirsty
I have been here for three days
I need to go home
I think it is very good
I'll be going home soon
I'm a yoruba boy
I'm married
I'm tired
change your clothes
clean the kitchen
has he arrived
is that enough
just for a moment
just for a while
let me check
let me think about it
lets play
lets sing
may I speak to miss labake
stand up
stand up
time has gone
time is going
to condemn
to condemn
to justify
to justify
we have never seen that before
